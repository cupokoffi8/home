Our founder, Lena Liu, through years of experience, realized that different \n          countries and regions have various artistic styles and tastes in art. Some works of art do not \n          have a positive acceptance in a given region, but the same art would be considered an exceptional \n          creation in another area of the world. This can diminish the interest of an artist’s talents, and \n          as a result, regional exhibitions can be a weak venue for the artist. In order to obtain a strong \n          interest in the art, we have our galleries located in China, Japan, Korea, Italy, France, the \n          United Kingdom, and the United States. The museums and galleries of many cities located in these \n          countries, have established a long term relationship with American Dragon. This allows the artist \n          to have the ability to showcase their creative talent through our professional partnerships.\n          </p>\n\n          <p id=\"p-bottom\">\n          We also offer many other services to our artists and those interested in the arts in China and the \n          United States. Artist visits, summer camps, art education, and tourism coordination are some of the \n          various services we can provide. Each service provided to the artist would be customized for the \n          artist’s individual exhibition and other business collaborations.
