Our founder, Lena Liu, through years of experience, realized that different \n          countries and regions have various artistic styles and tastes in art. Some works of art do not \n          have a positive acceptance in a given region, but the same art would be considered an exceptional \n          creation in another area of the world. This can diminish the interest of an artist’s talents, and \n          as a result, regional exhibitions can be a weak venue for the artist. In order to obtain a strong \n          interest in the art, we have our galleries located in China, Japan, Korea, Italy, France, the \n          United Kingdom, and the United States. The museums and galleries of many cities located in these \n          countries, have established a long term relationship with American Dragon. This allows the artist \n          to have the ability to showcase their creative talent through our professional partnerships.\n          </p>\n\n          <p id=\"p-bottom\">\n          We also offer many other services to our artists and those interested in the arts in China and the \n          United States. Artist visits, summer camps, art education, and tourism coordination are some of the \n          various services we can provide.

He was \n            blindfolded to create his art. After seeing many of his works, I have a new understanding \n            of Cai Jiang. He introduced his works to me, and talked about himself, explaining his \n            experience and artistic thoughts. He was also a Chinese Medicine Practitioner while he was \n            an artist. He immigrated to New York, USA in 1979.37 years appears to be exhausting to the \n            body and soul of the wanderer. He devoted himself to the study of Chinese Medicine, the yin \n            and the yang, blindfolded, no external pressure and interference, only the real inner world, \n            talking to himself, healing his injured heart. I miss my hometown, and I thank you now. \n            </p>\n            <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n            Chinese Medicine believes that the human body is originally a yin and yang coordinated whole. \n            Losing the balance of yin and yang, losing the visual pleasure, and the body and the mind become \n            exhausted. Cai Jiang pleasantly discovered that his yin and yang theory combined with contemporary \n            art creation has healed his wandering and tired heart. This yin and yang harmony is expressed in \n            his contemporary art creations. \n            </p>\n            <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n            He is the only creator, and many collectors are very fond of his work. The body and mind, the family, \n            the society, the only harmony, the sun shines, the world will be infinitely beautiful. Healing art. \n            </p>\n            <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n            These distinctive pieces have a mysterious sense of esoteric and space with the avant-garde art pioneer \n            Lucio Fontana (the unique artist style of the cut canvas, which gives the work a provocative yet elegant \n            feeling) or the specific art association of Master Murakami Saburo (the confrontation with flat materials, \n            with a series of broken cardboard on the body through a series of paper screens to capture a new architectural \n            form) influences. \n            </p>\n            <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n            Cai Jiang’s creative methodology is rigorously following the derivative and most direct approach of Chinese \n            Taoist Philosophy. The unpredictable aesthetic in the final work, through blindfolded eyes, uses consciousness \n            to create, and condenses into a moment of power and beauty. \n            </p>\n            <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n            The first chapter of the trilogy of the entire art performance begins behind a two-meter square, three layer canvas. \n            Cai Jiang, artist shaman, blindfolded through the entire canvas surface, each gesture is full of tension, each movement \n            is carefully designed and connected with its consciousness. Through behavior, a wide flow of space and follow-up \n            movements are extended; an incomprehensible, painful, and tangled behavior echoes the natural structure of nature \n            (such as thunder, heavy rain, or the madness of a hurricane). Through blindfolding, the artist created a space for \n            wireless freedom to overcome obstacles, get rid of the focus of the naked eye, and clear up thoughts and consciousness. \n            </p>\n            <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n            The second chapter incorporates the waving and the wandering of the rope, as well as the twine of different sizes, \n            to repair the original homogeneous, static planar form. This behavior symbolizes a healing of the mind and the body, \n            reaching an unexpected new balance. (for Cai Jiang, artistic creation is the deconstruction of intentional behavior, \n            creating a new balance of freedom from nothing). These two behaviors seem to depend on the purpose of Surrealism and \n            Dadaism, but they differ because of their lack of decision, choice, and opportunity. Each step is subconsciously \n            designed and reorganized, so the results are random. \n            </p>\n            <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n            The third and final steps are done by the viewer in front of the artist Shaman. When he takes off the eye mask, he \n            guides the viewer to pick one of the pre-mixed pigments, each color representing a state of mind. (for example, blue \n            represents the power of yin, red represents the power of yang, yellow represents neutrality, etc.). When the audience \n            picks their own colors, they need to cover their eyes, holding a paint can in one hand, and swaying the paint into a \n            torrent that forms a natural image. The power of the finished work can be compared to the masterpieces of the artist \n            Andre Masson or Jackson Pollack, or paintings by Australian indigenous wizards. \n            </p>\n            <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n            Cai Jiang’s “experience” can be regarded as a powerful work of art, or a solemn healing ceremony. “Performance Paintings” \n            retain a long-lasting experience in human memory and ideology because of their power and influence. Sticking to or escaping \n            from the form of artistic creation, behavioral paintings give us a new way of watching and healing, so that the material \n            itself and the human spirit meet. \n            </p> \n\n          </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n  \n  export default ArtTherapy;","import React from 'react'; \nimport './Headless.css'; \n\nfunction Headless() {\n  window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n    return (\n        <div>\n          <div className=\"Headless\">\n            <h1 className=\"exhibition\">Headless and Unintentional</h1> \n            <hr /> \n\n            <img src=\"./HU1.jpeg\" id=\"image-thing-hu\" /> \n\n            <br /> \n\n            <h6 id=\"head-hu\">\n            “Shen Jingdong and Cai Jiang: Headless and Unintentional” Exhibition \n            </h6> \n            <h5 id=\"caption\">\n            Date: Opening night, September 7, 2016\n            </h5> \n            <h5 id=\"caption\">\n            September 7 to September 30, 2016 \n            </h5>\n            <h5 id=\"caption\">\n            Exhibition: WhiteBox Gallery, 329 Broome Street, New York, NY 10002 \n            </h5>\n            <h5 id=\"caption\">\n            Collaboration: Curator, Lena Liu \n            </h5>\n            <h5 id=\"caption\">\n            Artists: Shen Jin Dong, Jon Tsoi \n            </h5> \n\n            <br /> \n\n            <img src=\"./HU2.jpeg\" id=\"image-thing-hu\" /> \n\n            <br /> \n\n            <h2 id=\"header-thing-hu\">\n            Curator Lena Liu stated: \n            </h2> \n\n            <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n            Shen Jing Dong and Cai Jiang, Headless and Unintentional Contemporary Art Exhibition, was \n            unveiled on September 7, 2016.

In the 1980’s, he was deeply influenced by \n              the “85 New Wave”. After graduating from a university in the 1990’s, he was assigned to the \n              military art troupe to work in stage art. He also worked on his own artistic creations. He \n              came to Beijing in 2004. Like most Chinese born in the 1960’s, he was born into the Cultural \n              Revolution and grew up in reform and opening. His childhood ideal education of red, and his \n              18 years of military experience, left him with a deep imprint and a reality with him today. \n              All of this is naturally reflected in Shen’s work. \n              </p> \n              <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n              In contrast, Cai Jiang’s universal philosophy of “doing nothing for nothing“ in Chinese philosophy, \n              embodies its randomness, unpredictability, and natural life wisdom. His paintings not only cover his \n              eyes and look inward, but also create contemporary art like the rain, the hair, the volcano, and the \n              earthquake. At the same time, the audience will close their eyes and experience the process of \n              resurrection, restoration, and healing brought about by the performance. In this form, the behavioral \n              healing of the “ Yellow Emperor’s Internal Classic” and the “separation” of the Argentine/Italian \n              artist Lucio Fontana, the new development after the Japanese legendary performance group Gutai Art \n              Association, has created a road to contemporary blind healing that has never been seen before. \n              </p> \n              <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n              Shen Jing Dong and Cai Jiang jointly completed such a wonderful exhibition of contemporary art, so \n              that their works can be interconnected and intertwined, profound, but opposite each other. Shen Jing \n              Dong created a gorgeous, positive energy military image, with Cai Jiang. It is a strong explosive \n              force of contrasts.

His artistic \n            creation pursues the combination of painting and music. Inspired by the works of Paul Klee \n            and Vasily Kandinsky, Qiu Zihao has explored the relationship between music and art. In the \n            course of his research, he has merged art and music with each other to create a new artistic \n            system that can identify and express the rhythm and melody of music through painting works. \n            Using this system, he has created many beautiful pictures, each of which contains a piece of \n            music. Through this combination of sight and hearing, he provides a new way for people to get \n            a more vivid perception and experience, while enjoying paintings and music melody at the same \n            time. \n            </p> \n\n            <img src=\"./SD1.jpeg\" id=\"image-thing-sd\" /> \n\n            <img src=\"./SD2.jpeg\" id=\"image-thing-sd\" /> \n\n            <img src=\"./SD3.jpeg\" id=\"image-thing-sd\" /> \n\n            <img src=\"./SD4.jpeg\" id=\"image-thing-sd\" /> \n          </div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n  \n  export default SanDiego;","import React from 'react'; \nimport './Victory-Of-Light.css'; \n\nfunction VictoryOfLight() {\n  window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n    return (\n        <div>\n          <div className=\"Victory-Of-Light\">\n            <h1 className=\"exhibition\">Victory of Light Exhibition</h1> \n            <hr /> \n\n            <h6 id=\"head\">\n              Organizers: \n            </h6>\n            <p id=\"points\">\n              Asian American Culture Media Group\n            </p>\n            <p id=\"points\">\n              American Dragon International Fine Art \n            </p>\n\n            <h6 id=\"head\">\n              Contractors: \n            </h6>\n            <p id=\"points\">\n              The Wall Street Art Space\n            </p> \n\n            <h6 id=\"head\">\n              Curators: \n            </h6>\n            <p id=\"points\">\n              Lena Liu \n            </p>\n            <p id=\"points\">\n              Apelles Zhou \n            </p> \n            <br></br>\n\n            <h2 id=\"header-thing\">\n              OPENING RECEPTION, FEBRUARY 8, 2020; 3:30 P.M. \n              </h2> \n              <p id=\"art-paragraph-other\">\n              Fifteen artists from nine countries will showcase their engaging photographs, paintings, \n              and installation / sculpture works of art that will be included in the next exhibition, \n              the International Light and Shadow Art Exhibition, 2020.

The Forbidden City, also officially known as the Palace Museum, was \n            originally built by the third emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Yongle Emperor. There were 24 emperors who lived here. \n            This palace was built between 1406 and 1420, but after numerous burns, reconstructions, demolitions and renovations, \n            most of the buildings you can see today date back to the 1700s.
