          American Dragon International Fine Art has partnerships with galleries in a wide range of 
          cities and countries. Our founder, Lena Liu, through years of experience, realized that different 
          countries and regions have various artistic styles and tastes in art. Some works of art do not 
          have a positive acceptance in a given region, but the same art would be considered an exceptional 
          creation in another area of the world. This can diminish the interest of an artist’s talents, and 
          as a result, regional exhibitions can be a weak venue for the artist. In order to obtain a strong 
          interest in the art, we have our galleries located in China, Japan, Korea, Italy, France, the 
          United Kingdom, and the United States. The museums and galleries of many cities located in these 
          countries, have established a long term relationship with American Dragon. This allows the artist 
          to have the ability to showcase their creative talent through our professional partnerships.

          We also offer many other services to our artists and those interested in the arts in China and the 
          United States. Artist visits, summer camps, art education, and tourism coordination are some of the 
          various services we can provide. Each service provided to the artist would be customized for the 
          artist’s individual exhibition and other business collaborations. Please contact us for additional 
          information today!
