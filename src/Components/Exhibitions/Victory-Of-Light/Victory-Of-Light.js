              Asian American Culture Media Group and American Dragon International Fine Art, LLC, have 
              achieved great success due to the integration of these two institutions, featuring a Cultural 
              Education Center and Art Gallery.  We use this business model to complement economic and 
              cultural advantages.  Our perfect location on Wall Street and The Trinity can represent material 
              and spiritual harmony.  Some of our clients are from the financial industry, including Mr. Stephen 
              Rockefeller.  These clients participate on a regular basis in support of our Art Exhibitions, 
              and we have cultivated a large group of collectors from this social circle.
