            </h5>
            <p id="art-paragraph-other">
            Your exploration of Beijing begins with a visit to Tiananmen Square, one of the largest public squares in the 
            world, and then into the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City, also officially known as the Palace Museum, was 
            originally built by the third emperor of the Ming Dynasty, Yongle Emperor. There were 24 emperors who lived here. 
            This palace was built between 1406 and 1420, but after numerous burns, reconstructions, demolitions and renovations, 
            most of the buildings you can see today date back to the 1700s. Then, visit the Pearl Factory to gain some knowledge 
            about fresh pearls.

            </h5>
            <p id="art-paragraph-other">
            On the way to the Great Wall, you will stop at the Jade Museum to learn the history of jade. Jade is pronounced 
            "jade" in China and has a history of at least 4,000 years in China. As they create complex designs, look at skilled 
            technicians. Then drive along the scenic countryside and mountains to the Great Wall, China's most famous monument. 
            There are fewer visitors and the original Juyong Pass, and try to avoid using the most accessible and therefore the 
            most crowded areas. The Great Wall winds through the mountains of northern China, from the Yellow Sea to the Gobi 
            Desert, more than 3,500 miles!

            </h5>
            <p id="art-paragraph-other">
            Hangzhou is considered the tea capital of China, so a visit to Hangzhou would not be complete without a trip 
            to a local tea house.  We will have a special visit to the Meijiawu Tea House in the hinterland of Xihu Park, 
            which is considered one of the most important Longjing tea products in China. Enjoy the natural environment 
            and beautiful rural scenery, while learning more about its special tea culture and how to appreciate the fresh 
            aroma of Longjing tea. In the teahouse, you will learn how to make Longjing tea, including picking, frying, 
            and tasting tea leaves. Afterwards, take a boat cruise on the West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which

            </h5>
            <p id="art-paragraph-other">
            In the morning, drive to Shanghai and visit the famous Bund. Shanghai is divided into east and west by the 
            Huangpu River. Modern large high-rise buildings can be seen in the east, while traditional European buildings 
            can be seen in the west. The Bund is a five-block waterfront promenade with many banks and trading houses in 
            Shanghai. China is famous for silk, so to be sure, we will take you to a silk mill. Then escort you to the 
            hotel to rest.

            After breakfast, you will visit Yu Garden, a classic garden among Shanghai's must-visit attractions. Its history 
            dates back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and was owned by a government official named Pan Yunyun. Yu Chinese means 
            pleasure and contentment. This garden was built for Pan's parents. It is a place where they could enjoy peaceful and 
            happy time in their old age.  Later in the day , we would visit the Huang Temple in the city, and it is  called 
            "Old Street". It refers to an ancient neighborhood with more than 100 temples, restaurants and shops. The area 
            contains narrow driveways and small squares in an "old China" environment.
