            <p id="art-paragraph">
            Avatamsaka Sutra says: "There are five color flowers in Buddha's world. Through flowers, 
            one can see a world in a single piece of flower, one can see a Buddha in a single piece 
            of leaf." The venerable layperson Mr. Puchu Zhao once said: "There are Buddha’s worlds 
            in Buddhist paintings. Buddhist paintings manifest Buddha’s worlds." Using artwork as 
            expedient way to spread Buddha’s doctrine has more than 2000 years of history in China.

              As it is said in Buddhism: "Experience the nature of the mind through seeing phenomena. 
              The nature of the mind cannot be perceived without the presence of the phenomena. 
              ”Buddhism and the art are interrelated through mutual complement and enhancement. 
              The extraordinary karmic bonds between the Buddhist Dharma and Chinese mural paintings 
              brought Chinese Buddhist mural paintings to its culmination of charisma which reflect 
              the majesty of the Buddhist world and perfection of the Avatamsaka Cosmos. Chinese 
              Buddhist mural paintings glorified the essence of Buddhism, and the Buddhist 
              transcendental wisdom elevated the glamour of Chinese Buddhist mural paintings to 
              its highly respected height in the world.  Chinese Buddhist mural painting is the 
              Prajna of art which annotates the emptiness wisdom of the reality in Buddhism.

              <p id="art-paragraph-other">
              Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes were painted by 15 royal painters including painting 
              officer Fuqing Wan, Shu Wang, painter Ping Zhang, Yi Wang, Xing Gu, Yuan Li, Fu Pan, 
              and Fulin Xu, who were appointed and supervised by royal eunuch Li, Tong, during

              {/* Bullet Points */} 

              <p id="art-paragraph-other">
              Among them, the “The Avalokitesvara with Water and Moon” and the “indra and Brahma 
              Prostrating Buddha and Protecting Dharma” are the most representative masterpieces. 
              Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes have notable Ming Dynasty hints with heritages from 
              the Tang Dynasty, the 5 Dynasties, and the Song Dynasty. They exhibit exquisite 
              subtlety, clear patterns, dazzling tone, and deep dharma philosophy through narrative 
              plot, arrangement of the figures, image design of subjects and composition of elements. 
              They integrate the metaphoric meaning and the Buddhist transcendental wisdom with the 
              statues of the Buddha and Bodhisattva. These paintings convey the emptiness nature of 
              all phenomenons. 
              </p> 

              <p id="art-paragraph-other">
              The frescoes cause people to experience the nature of mind directly. The frescoes merge 
              symbols, landscapes, flowers, woods and stone with smooth lines and bright colors. 
              Along with the rituals and disciplines of Buddhism, they are painted in the traditional 
              Chinese meticulous painting method, which is characterized by delicate brushstrokes, 
              close attention to details, brightly dotted colors and strict requirements in material 
              selections. They fully reflect the distinguished elegance, royal grandeur, and 
              meticulousness of the Imperial family. The Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes are the aesthetic 
              masterpieces among the noblest, the most matured, the most sophisticated Chinese Monastery 
              Murals. The artistry of the murals reached its apogee by congregating the quintessence of 
              Chinese monastery mural paintings through all periods. They generated a spectacular example 
              of religious art in human art history.

              <p id="art-paragraph-other">
              In 1993, antique appraisers, artists and religious leaders from Beijing evaluated Fahai 
              Zen Monastery Frescoes in its historical value, religion, art and painting skills. Through 
              comparison with the murals from Yuan Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, Qing Dynasty , experts 
              collectively agreed that Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes have their own merits, which could 
              match the beauty of renaissance murals in Europe. They are among the most precious masterpieces 
              in world mural art. Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes are first-grade national treasures in China.

              <p id="art-paragraph-other">
              When the late legendary Chinese mural painting expert Mr. Dingli Wang (1925-2009) led the 
              restoration and conservation of Yongle Frescoes, he found many mistakes and immaturities in 
              the paintings. However, after a comprehensive study, he could not find a single stroke of 
              mistake in Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes. The late remarkable Chinese meticulous painter 
              Mr. Jiezi Pan said: “Among the all ancient mural paintings I ever saw, Fahai Zen Monastery 
              Frescoes are the most detailed mural paintings that delimit details precisely.” He also 
              composed a poem for Fahai Monastery Frescoes:
              </p> 

              <p id="art-paragraph-poem">
              “Dunhuang Frescoes have both successful and unsuccessful brushstrokes among the marvelousness; 
              the detailed illustration of Yongle Palace Frescos are the benchmarks for meticulous paintings. 
              However, Fahai Monastery’s mural paintings are the most meticulous one of all the periods. 
              No other painting can compare itself with the exquisite details and metaphoric meanings of 
              Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes. What else painting can compete itself with the mystically elegant 
              significance of the Fahai Monastery Frescoes?”

              Chinese notable contemporary artists including Mr. Lingyun Qin, Mr. Weinuo Jin 
              and Mr. Yongnian Xue also gave Fahai Monastery Frescoes high evaluations. Fahai 
              Monastery Frescoes are treated as the highest achievement in Buddhist mural art 
              after the exploration of Kizil Caves Grottoes and Kucha Grottoes of A.D. 3 to 
              A.D. 4, for its exquisite, its solemnity, its magnificence, and its aesthetic 
              values.

              The “The Avalokiteshvara with Water and Moon”  of Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes 
              is acclaimed as the most significant painting of Avalokiteshvara in both Buddhist 
              and Art Communities.  Through the use of typical Buddhist elements, like crown, 
              keyura, seamless heavenly garment, silk gauze, and luminous light, the frescoes 
              symmetrically parallelled Sudhanakumara, Skanda Bodhisattva, Golden Haired Hou-the 
              steed of Avalokitesvara, parrot.

              <p id="art-paragraph-other">
              On the immense watery cloud background, the frescoes are spotted auspicious clouds, 
              bamboo garden, red peony, red coral, magnolia tree, artocarpus tree, eupatorium flower, 
              and treasure vase, symbolizing longevity mountain, symbolizing prosperity ocean, and 
              clear spring water; all of those Buddhist elements bring out the evocative brightness 
              and solemnity of Buddhist pure-land and the Buddhist meaning of“ the dependent existing 
              of the heavens is not a truly existence; the true nature of the watery moon is emptiness”.

              <p id="art-paragraph-other">
              By adopting the painting skills in Song Dynasty, Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes attribute 
              human characteristics and emotional charm to Avalokiteshvara. As a result of this effort, 
              Avalokiteshvara has a heart-warming deportment, tranquil and compassionately amicable 
              expression. The frescoes fully reflect the Buddhist teachings of transcendence wisdom and 
              life liberation. Just looking at “The Avalokiteshvara with Water and Moon” silently, the 
              painting will bring us into the Buddha’s world of emptiness and infinite compassion. That 
              is a world of nonduality. It is incredible to find the similarities between the “The 
              Avalokiteshvara with Water and Moon” of Fahai Zen Monastery Frescoes and the “Sistine Madonna  
              of Sistine Chapel,  Italian Painter Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino of the High Renaissance. 
              The painting of “The Avalokiteshvara with Water and Moon” is crowned the eastern “Sistine Madonna”.

              pure ones, there are totally 36 humanized celestial figures and 7 divine animal figures 
              were painted on the eastern and the western wall of the main shrine hall. Some of them

              golden toad, and purple golden dragon.

              The “Indra and Brahma Prostrating Buddha and Protecting Dharma” was composed by murals 
              of the eastern wall and western wall. Standing face to face, Indra and Brahma lead 
              celestial beings, ghost beings, female devas, mantra masters heading to puja. They are 
              either in small groups, or greeting each other, or performing their supernatural power. 
              All those components together result in a vigorous, magnificent, stunning and breathtaking 
              scenario of mightiness. All figures are related but each figure has a unique expression 
              to convey different identity, characteristic and quality.

              each figure, the illustrations on Fahai Zhen Monastery Frescoes reflect the Buddhist 
              stories and teachings with wish fulfilled blessing. Differentiated not only through 
              holding item and body movement, each figure is characterized by its unique reaction

              For instance, Caturmahārājakayika ( heavenly king) and vajrapani both are Buddhist 
              protectors with majestic appearance and great dignity. In the “Indra and Brahma 
              Prostrating Buddha and Protecting Dharma”, the heavenly king is portrayed especially 
              in his tenderness and sedateness. On the other hand, Vajrapani, the “wielder of the 
              thunderbolt” in Buddhist liturgy is with wrathful looking. By humanizing heavenly 
              beings with emotions and feministic personalities, the heartwarming murals are more 
              closed to real-life situations.

              and Shanxi province’s Yongle Frescoes of the Yuan Dynasty in both appearance and composition. 
              They have Gu, Kaizi’s brush lines of “Spring Silkworms Spitting Silk”, Cha, Zhongda’s 
              “Wet-clothing Drawing”, and Wu Daozi’ s “Wu's Belt Floating in Wind". Mural paintings were
